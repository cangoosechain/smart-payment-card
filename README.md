# smart-payment-card

A green loyalty rewards smart card on Chia Network.

## Description

SECURE ON THE BLOCKCHAIN Security Is First And Foremost: The cards identity and account information is protected as it is built on Chia blockchain. The information within the card is not actually on the card. It is in the cloud and the information cannot be skimmed. When sorting through which card to use, it can only be authorized by a registered biometric finger print reader. The card is chosen, and only be unlocked by a 4 or 6 PIN entry to make an actual transaction. That is 4 times the security to keep your data safe and secure. If the card is ever lost or stolen, the card can be turned off, deactivated and even located through the associated APP and website. The CANGOOSE Card has a GPS and Cellular chip within it. URL about CANGOOSE card and CANGOOSE PAY will be posted online. Our banking feature will be Instant private, encrypted messaging for world-wide secure P2P, B2B payments, loans, deposits in Crypto and / or Fiat. Use crypto and / or fiat at Point of Sale (online and offline)
